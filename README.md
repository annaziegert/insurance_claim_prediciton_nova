# Car Insurance Claim Prediction

Welcome to our project repository for Car Insurance Claim Predictions. This work was carried out under the guidance of Professor Qiwei Han as part of our Machine Learning course at Nova School of Business and Economics.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car insurance claims based on a number of variables including demographics, policy details, and prior claim records. We have utilized various machine learning models, comparing their performances and ultimately selecting the model with the highest ROC-AUC score for our final predictions.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset [Car Insurance Claim Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifteshanajnin/carinsuranceclaimprediction-classification). It includes variables such as customer age, vehicle type, and past claim history, among others, which are used to predict whether an insurance claim will be filed or not.

## Methodology

We began by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics and distributions of our data. Following that, we prepared our data for machine learning, which included steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

We then trained several machine learning models on our prepared data, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XG Boosting. We compared their performance using the ROC-AUC metric.

The model with the best ROC-AUC score was selected for our final predictions. We also implemented a grid search and cross-validation approach to fine-tune our model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Contributing
This project is a result of collaborative effort from our dedicated team. We welcome any constructive feedback and suggestions for improving our model. If you have any queries or need further clarification on any aspect of the project, feel free to raise an issue in this repository.

We hope you find our project informative and insightful!

## Acknowledgment
We would like to extend our deepest gratitude to Professor Qiwei Han for his continuous support and guidance throughout this project.
